# LAP-1-Code-Challenge
Paired coding challenge with @Harrismawardi 

## Tasks for this challenge

- [x] Create a repo and a review branch

- Create a Google Clone with the following:
- [x] A Logo
- [x] A Search Bar
- [x] Two Buttons

- [] Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
- [] Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.

## Tips and Rules 

- Create a new repo on GitHub early and push a basic README.md
- Very early on, before you've pushed any more code to GitHub, make a new branch on GitHub called review/feedback/free-beer, whatever you like. Don’t push or merge anything to it, we’ll use it tomorrow for review purposes.
- When you find out who your review partners are, add them as collaborators
- When ready to submit for review, make all final commits and push to your working branch
- Make a Pull Request to your review branch, from your working branch
- Do not merge this PR!
- Request review on your PR by adding your review partners as reviewers by clicking the cog next to 'Reviewers' on the pull request page
- Keep an eye out in your own email and/or GitHub notifications to see when you have been requested to review another team's work!
